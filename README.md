# Vanilla-Neural-Micrograd

## micrograd

This is a minimal implementation of a neural network library in Python, based on the micrograd library created by Andrej Karpathy. It allows you to define computational graphs, perform automatic differentiation, and train neural networks from scratch.

### Features:

Define variables and operations to build computational graphs

Perform automatic differentiation using backpropagation

Train a neural network to learn a simple function
